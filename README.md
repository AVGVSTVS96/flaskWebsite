# **flaskWebsite**
### This is the second iteration of my website. It's built using Flask and TailwindCSS

## **Components**
This website features text components in addition to a formspree form. The form works flawlessly, it sends an email to my inbox.

I created a gradient border around my text box using the following tailwind code:
```css
from-violet-600 via-blue-600 to-fuchsia-600
```
I also added this gradient to a border at the top of my page.

These components and styles come together to create a simple but aesthetically pleasing website. I'm very happy with the way it turned out and I'm excited to continue building on it.
